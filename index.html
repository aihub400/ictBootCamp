                <p>"Good vibes" is a colloquial expression that refers to a sense of positive emotional energy or a
                    pleasant atmosphere that can be felt in a person, place, or situation. The term "vibes" is short for
                    "vibrations," a concept that originally comes from spiritual and metaphysical beliefs, which suggest
                    that all things emit energy. When someone talks about "good vibes," they’re usually describing the
                    overall feeling of well-being, peace, or happiness that something gives off—even if it's intangible.
